# Advent of Code 2023

Here is my take on the daily challenges of the [Advent of Code 2023](https://adventofcode.com/2023).

I have chosen to do the challenges in JavaScript, to be run in a terminal.

## How to run my solutions to the challenges

With Node installed, open your Terminal and run commands like so:

```bash
node ./day-1/part-1 # for Day 1 - part 1
node ./day-1/part-2 # for Day 1 - part 2

node ./day-2/part-1 # for Day 2 - part 1
node ./day-2/part-2 # for Day 1 - part 2

# ...and so on...
```
